UBUNTU 14.04 LTS

Building on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is pretty straightforward.  If you start with
minimalistic server install, then you will need to install a few
dependencies using the Apt package manager.  If you are logged in as an
unprivledged user (not root), the following should statisfy all of the
requirements.

sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev
sudo apt-get install libjansson-dev

After installing these, continue with the instructions for compiling
and configuring in the README.md


MOUNTING AT BOOT TIME

If you would like for the mediafire-fuse module to mount your remote
filesystem at boot-time, you will need to follow these instructions.

Put the following in your /etc/fstab:

/usr/bin/mediafire-fuse /mountpoint fuse user,noauto 0 0

NOTE:  The noauto option is necessary because this will fail otherwise
when auto mounting on boot. The user option allows you to run mount
as non-root. You can then mount using the following command:

XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/username/.config XDG_CACHE_HOME=/home/username/.cache mount /mountpoint

Setting these two environment variables will ensure that mediafire-fuse
will use the right directories for the config and cache.
