 The mediafire-tools project offers these programs

 account like ftp(1).
 mediafire-fuse: a fuse module that is able to mount
 the mediafire share locally.
 Coming soon:
 mediafire-check: a tool that will check to see if a file
 is eligible for instant upload or whether or not a file
 is already in your account
