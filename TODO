 - use __attribute__ ((warn_unused_result));
 - replace sizeof for key, name and hash with #define-ed values
 - use less realloc but instead only realloc to double the size when array gets full
 - store more efficient structure on disk (for example by making filenames zero terminated)
 - make h_entry more efficient in memory (for example by making filenames zero terminated)
 - when handling device/get_changes, make sure to only use the latest revision of the same file-/folderkey
