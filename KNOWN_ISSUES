For a list of engineering work that still needs to be completed, see the

GENERAL

* PC-BSD 10.1 and similar derivatives come with an insufficient CA bundle
  for validating the MediaFire certificate.  Use either --lazy-ssl option
  to connect (not recommended for long term use) or update the  CA bundle
  that your OpenSSL stack is using.
