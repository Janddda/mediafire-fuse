For a list of engineering work that still needs to be completed, see the
TODO file.  This list serves to identifies issues that pertain to broken
(or older systems) as well as issues that are less esoteric.

GENERAL

* PC-BSD 10.1 and similar derivatives come with an insufficient CA bundle
  for validating the MediaFire certificate.  Use either --lazy-ssl option
  to connect (not recommended for long term use) or update the  CA bundle
  that your OpenSSL stack is using.

MEDIAFIRE FUSE

* Lots of editor tools will not work until the MediaFire API is updated
  to support zero-byte files.  Tools like LibreOffice will report strange
  errors when trying to save files back to the FUSE drive.
