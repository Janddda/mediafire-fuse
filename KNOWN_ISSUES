For a list of engineering work that still needs to be completed, see the
TODO file.  This list serves to identifies issues that pertain to broken
(or older systems) as well as issues that are less esoteric.

GENERAL

* PC-BSD 10.1 and similar derivatives come with an insufficient CA bundle
  for validating the MediaFire certificate.  Use either --lazy-ssl option
  to connect (not recommended for long term use) or update the  CA bundle
  that your OpenSSL stack is using.

MEDIAFIRE FUSE

* Some tools like LibreOffic will create hidden lock files while they are
  being edited.  These lock files will get uploaded when they are created.
  In the event that they don't get deleted from the cloud after they are
  no longer used, LibreOffic will report that the file is already in use
  by an unknown user.  To rectify this problem, simply delete the files
  from the folder by navigating to them in your account with a web
  browser.
